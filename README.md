# Eblo Client
A Fancy Engineering Blogs Reader.

This is the iOS Client for my [Eblo](https://github.com/jindulys/EbloVaporServer) project.

This project is built with **Realm**, **IGListKit**.
NOTE: For now, Realm and IGListKit seems not work very well with each other. My project for now has an bug related to latest blog update. I will use another solution other than IGListKit.
